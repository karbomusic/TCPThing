# TCPThing

This app is for testing various TCP connections and socket options and/or various TCP connection based testing. Right now only TCP keep-alive is configurable by passing in arguments. It needs some refactoring, cleanup and better coding but it's something I modify as needed since it's just a test tool for corner-case issues.
